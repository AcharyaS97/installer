# Mangium Installer
A command line tool that clones Mangium and gets you ready in a matter of minutes

## Usage
If you are on windows, download the executable and run it in cmd, powershell, or git bash.

If you are not on windows, as this is a command line tool, clone the repository into a new folder and run it using `node installer` (presuming your cwd is the parent directory of where you cloned the installer's repository)

Both of these methods use the same parameters.

Bare in mind, the installer installs Mangium into a folder that it will create inside your current working directory.

## Faq
 - If I use the installer again will it overwrite my data?
    - No. The installer clones the repository instead of downloading it, and the repository contains no file that will overwrite your data.
