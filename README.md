# Mangium Installer
A command line tool that clones Mangium and gets you ready in a matter of minutes

## Usage
Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Mangium/installer.git` and run `node .` inside the cloned repository.

This is a command line tool. It has two questions you need to answer (arrow keys & enter key)

Bare in mind, the installer installs Mangium into a folder that it will create inside your current working directory.

## Faq
 - If I use the installer again will it overwrite my data?
    - No. The installer clones the repository instead of downloading it, and the repository contains no file that will overwrite your data.
